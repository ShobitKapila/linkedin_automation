// TO_DO

//Sending messages directly through the LinkedIn messaging system requires a LinkedIn API integration and the appropriate permissions. You'll need to use the LinkedIn API to send messages through the LinkedIn platform.

//Here's a general outline of the steps to send messages via LinkedIn messaging using the LinkedIn API:

//Set up a LinkedIn Developer App: Create a LinkedIn Developer App on the LinkedIn Developer Platform. This app will provide you with API credentials (client ID and client secret) that you'll use to authenticate with the LinkedIn API.

//Authenticate with the LinkedIn API: Use the LinkedIn API to authenticate your app and obtain an access token. This token is required for sending messages on behalf of a LinkedIn user.

//Access LinkedIn Messaging: Use the LinkedIn API to access the LinkedIn messaging system. You will need to target specific LinkedIn profiles by their LinkedIn user IDs or other identifiers.

//Compose and Send Messages: Compose your personalized messages and send them to the targeted LinkedIn profiles through the LinkedIn messaging API.

//Handle Rate Limits: LinkedIn's API has rate limits, so you should add appropriate rate-limiting logic to avoid exceeding these limits.
